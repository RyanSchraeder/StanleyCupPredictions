    "- By dropping the goal amounts per game, I can use feature importance to deduce the importance of those variables especially by seeing the decline in accuracy afterward. Dropping them to see if that makes a difference was successful, but I should also try permutation importance for other variables, then select those of most impact. \n",
    "- Using a reliable method of stats over time and not getting rid of time-series data might be useful. In other words, trying a rolling average for each statistic if possible might help to overcome having an overall team-summary from the regular season represented as its stats. Having a history of stats would be most conducive to team growth and how they perform\n"
